1. Use "python setup.py install --user" when installing PAHO library to avoid permission errors when compiling and running files
2. Things.PH is my broker. Not MQTT lens. It's simply a GUI that can accept broker services for you.

General idea.
-Connect (To broker/intermediate GUI)
-Subscribe to messages (recieve messages)
-Publish to messages (send messages)
-Check the recieved messages / callback confirmation
-Loops, repeatitively send messages or recieve message until process is finished


Questions for myself.
What is a callback function?
